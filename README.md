# DessiBigBirthday

Dessi's birthday is on Friday 9th. This page is to get information our about a surprise on the 10th, which is a big lunchtime gathering opposite the Albert Hall in Kensington Gardens.

I'm also organising a bus to drive round various bits of London that are important to Dessi. The bus seats 60, and will be mostly choir.

We're doing this on the 10th because it's a Saturday, and the choir has a gig on Friday 9th. 


## Picnic

Bring food and drink and picnic mats to eat and share. Bring friends. Tell Dessi's friends, in case I've missed them,

Some of us will arrive by bus: 12 noon, Albert Hall (or Serpentine Gallery).

Bad weather: I don’t yet have a plan.



## Bus – 10:30 York Road, Near Waterloo

Bus pickup Saturday 10:30 am from Waterloo, York Road 
– not sure which side, yet.
– I hope this will be a surprise to Dessi
– please gather earlier so there’s a crowd to greet her (and so we can set off)

Bus dropoff at 12 noon Hyde Park for a picnic.

Bad weather: singing downstairs (some shelter upstairs)

Hi All!
We’re celebrating Dessi on her big birthday in two weeks time. As part of that, I’m organising a bus (choir’s paying!) and a picnic on Saturday 10th. Here are details.

## More about the bus

No booze on the bus. No loos, either. I don’t know whether we’ll be able to pick up or drop off when we’re on the move.
90 minute trip, taking in many spots important to Dessi. Probably East along the South Bank, then crossing over the Thames and returning West to the park. 

The bus takes 60 people (min, I’m talking with them about the size). I want as many singers as we can, and some kids. It’ll be hard to move around if it’s full. There’s space for some partners, but probably not all partners. 

## For you to do 

For the bus: 
* Please let me know if you want to come on  the bus, and if you’re keen to bring someone else.
* If you’ve got the big banner, or some bunting, or other decorations, consider bringing them.
* If you want to be a central point for coordination on the day, volunteer.
For the picnic: 
* Please let me know if you happen to have connections with any particular group of people i.e. kids’ choir parents, baby choir singers, BG school people, ex-choir singers.

Send me questions. I may move fixed info and answers to a web page so that I’m not cluttering this chat.

Ta – James
