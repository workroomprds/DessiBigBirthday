# Dessi's Big Birthday 10 May

Dessi's birthday is on Friday 9th. I'm orgaising a surprise lunchtime gathering opposite the Albert Hall in Kensington Gardens on Saturday 10th.

I'm also organising a bus to drive round various bits of London that are important to Dessi. The bus seats 60, and will be mostly choir.

We're doing this on the 10th because it's a Saturday, and the choir has a gig on Friday 9th. 

I'm Dessi's husband James, I'm on **07904158752**, call me or text me if you need me.


## Picnic 12 noon Albert Memorial

Opposite the Albert Hall, near the Albert Memorial, noon onwards.

Bad weather: I don’t yet have a plan.


_If you want to meet the bus, it should arrive before 12 noon near the Albert Hall._

### For picnicers to do 

* let me know if you're up for helping get some food etc. to the picnic. For instance: I may need someone to go pick up a cake.
* let me know if you want to contact some friends, or if you happen to have connections with any particular group of people. 
* let me know if you need anything from me to make it possible for you.
* do bring food and drink and picnic mats to eat and share.
* don't bring _all_ the food.
* do bring friends. Please do check in with London friends of Dessi, in case I've missed them.

## Bus – 10:30 York Road, Near Waterloo

Bus pickup Saturday 10:30 am from Waterloo, York Road 
* not sure which side, yet.
* I hope this will be a surprise to Dessi
* please gather earlier so there’s a crowd to greet her (and so we can set off)
* if you're late, I can't be sure that you'll be able to get on the bus – I can ask the driver where a pickup might be on the route, and I'll share that.

Bus dropoff at 12 noon Hyde Park for a picnic.

Bad weather: singing downstairs (some shelter upstairs)


### Bus List
This is the definitive list of bus people – I'll update it as I go. It's got count and group size. 

**Let me (James) know if you see any surprises**.

* 4	4	Dessi, James, K&Y
* 6	2	Rada and Sofia
* 8	2	Alenka and small
* 9	1	Kasia
* 10	1	Ulrike
* 11	1	Polly
* 14	3	Moni & Ivor & Finn
* 15	1	Nina M
* 16	1	Alison
* 17	1	Alex
* 18	1	Ron
* 19	1	Annie
* 22	2	Lucy & Geoff
* 23	1	Cate
* 24	1	Zeebar
* 25	1	Ulrike
* 26  1 Eleanor
* 27  1 Deanna

The bus takes up to 60 people. I want as many singers as we can, and some kids. It’ll be hard to move around if it’s full. There’s space for some partners, but probably not all partners. 


### More about the bus

90 minute trip, taking in many spots important to Dessi. Probably East along the South Bank, then crossing over the Thames and returning West to the park. 

No booze on the bus. No loos, either. I don’t know whether we’ll be able to pick up or drop off when we’re on the move.

I hope that we will go West (past the RFH, NT, Southwark Cathedral), North into the City (past St Ethelburga's), then head West (the Barbican tunnel, Farringodn, Chancery Lane). Then Westminster, Sloane Square, the V&A, RCM, the Embassy and the park.


### For busriders to do 

For the bus: 
* Please let me know if you want to come on  the bus, and if you’re keen to bring someone else.
* If you’ve got the big banner, or some bunting, or other decorations, consider bringing them.
* If you want to be a central point for coordination on the day, volunteer.
For the picnic: 
* Please let me know if you happen to have connections with any particular group of people i.e. kids’ choir parents, baby choir singers, BG school people, ex-choir singers.
